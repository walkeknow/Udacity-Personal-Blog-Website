                    Argentina is a massive country that offers something for literally everyone. It’s possibly the most
                    diverse country in South America, home to spectacular mountains, enormous glaciers, and one of the
                    most
                    vibrant and historical cities in the world. Deciding how to spend two weeks in Argentina can be a
                    monumental task.

                        How do you choose between hiking
                        the mountains in Patagonia to the south, exploring the jungle to the northeast, seeking out the
                        desert
                        to the northwest or visiting the wine regions in between?!

                    Locals here, due to the capital’s port location, are referred to as porteños, and they stay up late.
                    Dinner is usually eaten after 9pm, so merienda, a mid-afternoon break (akin to British tea time), is
                    common between 4-6pm. Coffee, medialunas (small croissants) and sandwiches are typical merienda
                    fare, as
                    is mate, Argentina’s ubiquitous tea. On sunny days parks will be full of porteños soaking up rays
                    and
                    passing the mate gourd around to family and friends. They take their time, and it is apparent from
                    day
                    one that Argentines enjoy life. And caffeine.

                    Two weeks in Argentina are two weeks you will never regret. It’s a beautiful country filled with
                    beautiful landscapes and beautiful, friendly people. It can be tempting to spend less time in each
                    location to squeeze more in, but fight the urge. Take your time to take it all in properly. I hope
                    this
                    Argentina itinerary gives you the best first experience in the country and hope you’ll keep
                    returning!
